# Pixel Slash: Hack and Slash

## Overview

Pixel Slash is a 2D hack and slash video game created in the Unity Engine. The game utilizes a 2D sprite-based art style, drawing inspiration from games like The Legend of Zelda. The objective of the game is for the player to navigate through three stages, defeating all enemies in each room to complete the game. 

## Gameplay

The player controls the character using the W, A, S, and D keys for movement, and the mouse to change the character's direction and to attack. The player can choose between three different weapons by pressing the numbers 1, 2, or 3:

*   **Sword (1):** This weapon requires close-range combat and deals one point of damage to enemies. It has the shortest cooldown time, allowing for quick consecutive attacks. 
*   **Magic Staff (2):** This weapon is a ranged weapon that shoots a beam of light, capable of hitting multiple enemies at once. The magic staff deals two points of damage to enemies but has the longest cooldown time between attacks.
*   **Bow and Arrow (3):** This is a ranged weapon that deals one point of damage to enemies. The bow and arrow has a medium cooldown time between attacks.

**Levels:**

*   **Level 1:** The first level is set in a forest environment with destructible bushes that act as barriers. The enemies in this level are slimes, which exhibit random movement patterns.
*   **Level 2:** This level features a similar forest setting to the first level, but with a different layout and more enemies, including both slimes and ghosts. 
*   **Level 3:** This level is a dungeon environment with impassable stone walls that create a maze-like layout.  The dungeon level is the most challenging, containing a larger number of both slime and ghost enemies.

## Features

*   Retro 2D pixel art inspired by games like Zelda, Pokemon, and Noita.
*   Simple controls using keyboard and mouse.
*   Three unique stages: a lush green forest, a forest entrance leading to a dungeon, and a dark and atmospheric dungeon.
*   Three different weapons offering varied gameplay: sword, magic staff, and bow and arrow. 
*   HUD features: a health bar, a coin counter (not yet implemented), and weapon display.

*   A functioning coin system to act as a score counter. 
*   More levels and a potential boss fight at the end of the game.

## Game Art 

The game's art style is 2D sprite-based. All assets used in the game are free assets sourced from the Unity Asset Store and Itch.io.

**Assets Used:**

*   Forest Assets: "Mystic Woods" asset pack by Game Endeavor
*   Dungeon Assets: "16 x 16 Pixel Art Mini Dungeon" by Aztharis from Itch.io
*   Player and Enemy Sprites: From an asset pack by Brahim Abdelmoumene, obtained through a tutorial video

The sprites for the player and enemies were animated using Unity's animation components.
